# fastAPI
Learning the main concepts of FastAPI and how to use it to quickly create web APIs that implement best practices by default.

FastAPI is the framework youâ€™ll use to build your API, and Uvicorn is the server that will use the API you build to serve requests.

## Running the app
```python
uvicorn main:app --reload
``` 

The ```-reload``` command means that when you update your application code, the server will reload automatically.
